### What I learned

It's always fun to get back to basics.

Although this project may seem simple, if you don't plan beforehand, the evolution of the project may get tricky.

It's always a good thing to draft your early ideas (even if it's on paper), write down plain HTML and only then start coding.

When coding starts, it's good if you firstly write the global styles, then start writing the HTML. Thereafter start sculpting the main idea.

Another tricky part is that one concerning flex-box and/or grid. One has to decide wheter he will use Flex-box or CSS Grid (no problem at all using both also).
One has to be carefull no to let the flex-boxes entangle with each other, creating some later problems that can be avoided with some previous planning.
